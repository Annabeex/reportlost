      <p className="mb-6 text-sm text-center text-gray-600 italic">
        "Behind every lost item, there's a story. Behind every return, there's relief."
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Why We Created ReportLost.org</h2>
      <p className="mb-5">
        It all started with a lost backpack in a busy airport. Despite hours of calls, emails, and online forms,
        we realized how fragmented and frustrating the process was. People either gave up or never even tried.
        We knew there had to be a better way ‚Äî more accessible, more human.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        That's how ReportLost.org was born: out of a personal experience, and a desire to help people reconnect with what they‚Äôve lost ‚Äî
        whether it's a phone, a suitcase, or something more sentimental.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Combining Technology with Human Care</h2>
      <p className="mb-5">
        Our platform uses a custom-built algorithm powered by image recognition and contextual data
        (time, place, keywords, public databases) to match lost item reports with found items across multiple channels.
        This includes transport agencies, public listings, and community reports.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        But we don‚Äôt stop at automation. Each report is reviewed by a human, who follows up manually when a match looks promising.
        We believe technology is powerful ‚Äî but compassion, intuition and persistence are equally essential.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">A Fair and Accessible Model</h2>
      <p className="mb-5">
        We‚Äôve chosen a ‚Äúpay-what-you-can‚Äù model. Submitting a report is always possible, and the price is entirely up to you.
        Whether you give $5, $20, or nothing at all, your report will still be treated seriously.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        Why? Because we believe peace of mind shouldn‚Äôt have a price tag. And because most people are fair when they know they‚Äôre being helped by real humans.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p className="mb-5">
        Our goal is to make ReportLost.org the most trusted lost & found platform in the U.S.
        We‚Äôre building partnerships with transportation services, airports, hotels, schools, and local governments to make the process even faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        And we‚Äôre just getting started.
